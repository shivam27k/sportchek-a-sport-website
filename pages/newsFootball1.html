      Real Madrid completed a league double over Barcelona with a 2-1 win over their bitter rivals in El Clasico this
      past weekend. Barcelona have fallen to third in the La Liga table and will need to keep plugging away to keep
      themselves in contention for the league title. The club are also preparing ahead of a busy summer transfer window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without further ado, let's take a look at the top stories involving Barcelona from
      <strong>
        14 April 2021.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>
        <center>Neymar confirms Paris Saint-Germain stay</center>
      </strong></p>
    <p>Amid rumours linking him with a return to Barcelona, Neymar has confirmed that he intends to commit his future to
      Paris Saint-Germain. Marca had earlier reported that Neymar's entourage is in talks with Barcelona, with the
      Brazilian seeking a reunion with Lionel Messi.</p>
    <p>However, speaking to ESPN Brazil after Paris Saint-Germain eliminated Bayern Munich from the UEFA Champions
      League, Neymar said:</p>
    <p><i>
        “This (the renewal) is no longer an issue. Obviously, I feel very comfortable and at home here at PSG. I feel
        happier than I was before.”
      </i>
    </p>

          Barcelona in talks with Sergio Aguero's agent
        </center>
      </strong></p>
    <p>Ever since Luis Suarez left Barcelona last summer, the Catalans have been without an out-and-out striker. Lionel
      Messi has stepped up to the plate once again but they are actively looking to add a striker to their team and they
      are looking at Sergio Aguero as one of their options.</p>
    <p>Fabrizio Romano confirmed today that Barcelona are indeed in talks with Sergio Aguero's agent. Manchester City
      have confirmed that the Argentine will leave the club when his contract expires in the summer.</p>
    <p>Given how cash-strapped Barcelona are, signing Sergio Aguero on a free will be a good move for them.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <center>
          Barcelona working on getting Erling Haaland deal across the line
        </center>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>Wednesday's edition of Mundo Deportivo (via Sport Witness) carries 'Plan Haaland' as its main headline. The
      report goes into the details of Barcelona's plan to sign the Borussia Dortmund striker, whose representatives met
      with the club's top brass to discuss a potential move last week. </p>
    <p>The report claims that Erling Haaland is Barcelona's 'big target'. However, due to their financial position,
      Barcelona are hoping that they can lure Haaland with the prospect of playing alongside Lionel Messi before going
      on to become the main man at the club once the latter steps down.</p>
    <p>As such, Barcelona will ask Erling Haaland to take a wage cut and he will earn less than he would at any of his
      other potential destinations.</p>
    <p>Barcelona are also hoping that Real Madrid will focus their efforts towards signing Kylian Mbappe as that will
      significantly work in their favour since the Spanish clubs are reportedly the frontrunners for Haaland's
      signature.</p>
